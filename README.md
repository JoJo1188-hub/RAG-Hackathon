# RAG-Hackathon

I made a simple app "Chat with your pdf!" that can interact with a bulky pdf and collect and dislay a precise answer using all the relevant points throughout the pdf.
It is built using the python language and run by streamlit

I made use of the following azure functionalities:
☀️ Azure AI Search
☀️ Azure Open AI
☀️ Azure Blob storage

Here, I have uploaded the pdf from my local device, for a more general use case I can make use of
☀ Azure Form Recognizer Service


The following is the architecture diagram!
